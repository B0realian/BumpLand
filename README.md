Small project intended to create landscape meshes out of textures, primarily high resolution bumpmaps.

As of 2025-01-24:
The project works as intended but with minimal support. It will only accept uncompressed TGA-images (because they are easy to import) and there is no way to save the resulting mesh.
For anyone who wishes to compile the source: you need to link GLFW and GLEW to the project.
The renderer is, as you will have already guessed, made with OpenGL and is very bare bones but rendered 33.5 million triangles on my laptop (GTX 4070) in 150 fps.
Other demands means I am currently putting this on hiatus.
